This module is being developed as an Google Summer of Code '12 Project
for Fedora Insight.
Use Cases: //fedoraproject.org/wiki/Insight_use_cases_for_status_and_microblogging

The module specifies a block 'Insight Publish' to enable users to post authenticated
status messages on Insight Website and also promote them to be added to Fedora's feed
at Identi.ca.
Users with access permission 'Post as Fedora' can directly post it to Identi.ca while
others can only add their message to the moderation queue to be approve or rejected by
a user with aforementioned permission.
N.B. This module only provides the backend for posting to an external service
(integration is still under development)

function insight_publish_apt_place_to_post()
-specifies where the 'Insight Publish' box should be displayed
 currently it is set to display the block only on the front page

http://www.example.com/?q=identica
shows the current moderation queue and previously posted and rejected messages
